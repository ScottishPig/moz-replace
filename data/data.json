// NOTE: Replacements happen from the top down.
// If the top element changes X to Y, then a later element changes Y to Z, 
// all Xes become Zs.

// NOTE: This is purposefully a dumb replace.
// Unless you put whitespace before and after keys and values, these words
// will be replaced even if they're contained in other words. Conceivably,
// you could change all instances of a single letter to a different 
// letter / symbol (and watch all the links on a web page break).

// NOTE: Replacements are case-sensitive
